1. Explain the four pillars of object-oriented programming.

Inheritance
The property of acquiring all the properties and behaviors of the parent object by an object is termed as inheritance.


Encapsulation
Encapsulation is the packing of data and functions into one component (for example, a class) and then controlling access
 to that component to make a "blackbox" out of the object. Because of this, a user of that class only needs to know its
  interface (that is, the data and functions exposed outside the class), not the hidden implementation.

Abstraction
An abstraction is a way of hiding the implementation details and showing only the functionality to the users. In other
words, it ignores the irrelevant details and shows only the required one.

Polymorphism
 In polymorphism, multiple objects will have the same method but different implementation and depending upon the user
 preference the corresponding object will be selected and the method corresponding to that object will be executed.




 2.Differentiate between JRE, JVM and JDK.

   1. JDK (Java Development Kit) is a Kit that provides the environment to develop and execute(run) the Java program.
   JDK is a kit(or package) that includes two things
   Development Tools(to provide an environment to develop your java programs)
   JRE (to execute your java program).
   [12:34, 05/09/2022] 𝓡𝓼𝓾𝓻𝔂𝓪: 2. JRE (Java Runtime Environment) is an installation package that provides an environment
    to only run(not develop) the java program(or application)onto your machine. JRE is only used by those who only want
     to run Java programs that are end-users of your system.

   3. JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is a very important part of both JDK and JRE because it is contained or inbuilt in
   both. Whatever Java program you run using JRE or JDK goes into JVM and JVM is responsible for executing the java
   program line by line, hence it is also known as an interpreter.
